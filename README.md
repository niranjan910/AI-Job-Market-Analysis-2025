## Project Overview

This project presents an analytical view of the global AI job market in 2025. The focus is on understanding trends in compensation, in-demand skills, work formats (remote vs. onsite), regional hiring patterns, and the risk of automation. The objective is to generate data-driven insights to support:

- Strategic hiring and compensation decisions for organizations
- Career planning for professionals
- Policy formulation for AI workforce development

**Deliverables:**
- Python notebook: `AI_CareerScope.ipynb`
- Executive presentation: `AI Career Scope Documentation.pdf`
