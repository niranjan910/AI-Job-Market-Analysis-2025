## Assumptions and Notes

The dataset represents AI-related job postings globally for the year 2025. 
- 'Salary_USD' is assumed to be the standardized salary across all roles and countries, converted to USD.
- 'Remote_Ratio' is treated as a categorical variable with values [0, 50, 100] representing on-site, hybrid, and fully remote roles.
-  'Required_Skills' is a multi-label text field; skill extraction was performed using basic keyword matching.
- 'Application_Duration' is calculated as the number of days between 'Posting_Date' and 'Application_Deadline'.
- 'Application_Duration_Category' is a binned version of 'Application_Duration' to simplify trend analysis.
- Time-based columns like 'Posting_Month' and 'Application_Month' were derived from the respective datetime fields.
- All null values were handled during data cleaning and were either removed or imputed as appropriate.
- Outliers in continuous variables (e.g., extremely high salaries) were retained to preserve real-world variability.
- Visualizations focus on the top 5â€“10 categories for clarity where appropriate (e.g., top job titles or industries).
