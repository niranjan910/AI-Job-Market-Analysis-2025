# Project Background

This project explores the AI job market all over the world, focusing on global hiring trends, salary distributions, remote work patterns, and skills in demand. As a Data Analyst working within the AI and tech employment sector, the goal was to provide actionable insights that support strategic hiring, career planning, and workforce development initiatives.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* **Industry Trends**  
* **Skill Requirements**  
* **Geographic and Remote Work Patterns**  
* **Automation Risk and Future Growth**

The Python notebooks used to inspect, clean, and analyze the data can be found here: `AI_CareerScope.ipynb`  
An executive presentation summarizing the results can be found here: `AI Career Scope Documentation.pdf`

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The primary data fields are as follows:

* **Job Title** â€“ Role designation for each listing  
* **Industry** â€“ Employer's sector classification  
* **Required Skills** â€“ Technical and soft skills demanded  
* **Salary Range** â€“ Annual compensation in USD  
* **Work Type** â€“ Remote, Hybrid, or Onsite  
* **Company Size** â€“ Employer size classification  
* **Location** â€“ Country and city of the job  
* **Automation Risk** â€“ AI's potential to replace the role  
* **Growth Projections** â€“ Estimated demand in the future

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Remote AI jobs pay around 20% more than onsite roles. Industries like Healthcare AI and FinTech are leading adoption, while cities such as San Francisco, Bangalore, and London are the top job hubs. AI-specific skills are in high demand, with machine learning and cybersecurity at the forefront. Entry-level and repetitive roles face greater automation risk, while specialized roles show strong future potential.

# Insights Deep Dive

### Industry Trends

* **Manufacturing** leads with ~58 job roles, followed closely by **Education** and **Technology** sectors.
* **Finance**, **Telecom**, and **Entertainment** maintain moderate demand.
* **Transportation** had the least job postings (~39), indicating sector-specific adoption rates.

### Skill Requirements

* **Project Management**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Python** are the most frequently required skills.
* **Machine Learning**, **UX/UI Design**, **Sales**, and **Data Analysis** follow closely.
* Soft skills like **Communication** and hybrid skills like **Marketing** show a strong multidisciplinary demand.

### Location and Remote Work Patterns

* **San Francisco** offers a balanced mix of remote and onsite roles.
* **Paris** and **London** favor remote options, while **Sydney** and **Singapore** lean toward onsite roles.
* Remote-friendly culture is strong but varies widely by location.

### Automation Risk and Future Growth

* Roles like **AI Researcher**, **Product Manager**, and **HR Manager** show **low automation risk**, supported by high AI adoption.
* Roles such as **Sales Manager** and **Marketing Specialist** are more vulnerable due to routine tasks.
* Technical roles remain resilient, and AI is seen more as an enhancer than a replacer of jobs.

# Recommendations

* Focus upskilling on high-demand AI domains like **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **AI Strategy**.  
* Companies should offer **remote-first flexibility** to attract top-tier AI talent.  
* **Reskilling programs** are needed to move talent from high-risk to growth-oriented roles.  
* Governments and institutions should invest in **AI education and workforce transformation initiatives**.

# Assumptions and Caveats

* Less than 5% missing salary data was dropped instead of imputed.  
* Skill-based analyses used only complete listings to ensure quality.  
* Automation risk scores were taken from ML models and may contain predictive bias.  
* Remote vs Onsite classifications were manually standardized in some cases.
